// This Meal Suggester app is a simple Android application that helps someone decide what to eat based on the time of day. A person can enter either breakfast lunch and dinner and the app will display a list of meal suggestions for that specific time. The app includes a search button to display meal recommendations and a reset button to clear the input and results.
